# BTD - Bedside Table Display

Aim of the project is to create small device with display that is place on bedside table and present time, temperature and air quality info fetched from remote server and more.

## Features

* limited brightness/contrast control of OLED screen using photoresistor
  * SSD1306 has very limited output voltage control so only 2 stages: max and min with threshold on ambient light perceived by myself as dark
* time display with NTP source and Timezones (via summer and winter TimeChangeRule - see https://github.com/JChristensen/Timezone)
* local temperature reading and upload to InfluxDB (with auth())
* presentation of data from Lufdaten Air Monitor
  * [blog post about this data source](https://blog.dsinf.net/2019/01/budowa-stacji-pogody-z-czujnikiem-smogu-i-prezentacja-danych/)
  * input data from simple InfluxDB query - [luftdaten_json.md](luftdaten_json.md)
* IR control of what's displayed on screen; scenes:
  * basic clock with big font
  * air pollution and temperature from Lufdaten
  * local temperature and light measurement
  * system info/about

## Hardware

It's based on aruino style packed ESP8266, a microcontroller with WiFi stack and OLED display. More info like schematics and BOM in [hw directory](https://github.com/danielskowronski/btd/tree/master/hw).
